## My process

### Built with

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Next.js

### What I learned

I learn some basic use of Tailwind CSS and how to do a basic config for tailwind CSS. I begin learning how to do with tailwind what I already know with CSS.
I also learn't vercel rewrite with nextjs project could be challenging, especialy the work around Images component and this could cause losing some benefit of using nextjs.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS - Prettier](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier) - This is usefull when you want a consistant class order for tailwind
- [Eslint - Prettier - Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint) - This is usefull in order to use eslint and prettier
